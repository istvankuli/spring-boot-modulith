# spring-boot-modulith

This repository contains a simple TODO application built using Spring Boot 3 and Spring Modulith, with a PostgreSQL database running on Docker. The project is designed to demonstrate the power of modular monolith architecture by breaking down the application into distinct modules that are loosely coupled and follow the principles of domain-driven design. It leverages Docker and Docker Compose to streamline the setup and deployment of both the application and the database.
